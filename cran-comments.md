Dear CRAN maintainers, this is an update for the package. 
Three functions for cartographic downloads have been added, as well as a
vignette describing their use.
The version number of the package has been bumped to 1.0.0 since it has been 
in stable use for the last 3 years.

Best and many thanks for all your efforts!
